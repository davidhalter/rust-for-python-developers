Rust for Python Developers
==========================

What programming language are you choosing for a new project? This talk wants
to explore why we choose a programming language over another one. We will look
at the languages Python and Rust to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

Rust is a fairly new language and offers distinct advantages over most other
programming languages when it comes to performance and security. There are
however clear drawbacks.

We will look at side by side comparisons of code and learn how much harder it
is to write a lot of simple things in Rust.
