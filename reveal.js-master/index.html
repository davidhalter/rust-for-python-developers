## Rust for Python Developers

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello Python Summit - Python ❤️ Rust!");
}
```

Note:
Evangelize you all to the Cult of Rust
Last Python Summit, so I can say whatever I want
---

## Who's Dave

- Programming for almost 20 years
- 12 years of Python
- 2 years of Rust

Note:
- Delphi: Mandelbrot / Terrorist's Revenge
- Not on slides: PHP Pages mobile phones & IE 6 & Objective C & 3D thing first IPhone
- PHP Regex
---

## Who's Dave

- First good program: [Jedi](github.com/davidhalter/jedi)
- Work at cloudscale.ch with Python/Django and React & Go (for Kubernetes & Terraform)

Note:
- jedi-vim/parso 2012 3 years afghanistan
- cloudscale no money
- 5th best programmer / ts / mypy
- I like when programming is expressive, don't care about enterprise > 10 people

---

## Why Rust?

- Jedi could be faster
- Rust is considered to be 10-100 times faster in Micro Benchmarks

Note:
- Jedi Algorithms could be better
---

## The programming world likes Rust:

- Rust has 72k stars on GitHub
- CPython 48k stars on GitHub
- Both languages have liberal licenses, are "democratic" and have a friendly, big community
- Rust uses cargo as a package manager (> pip)

Note:
---

## Google Trends

Note:

### Stackoverflow Developer Survey 2022

- 86% loved Rust
- 67% loved Python

Note:
---

## This is mostly hype

- Python is the primary language in universities for science
- Rust is a language that's barely used in professional environments
- People loved Python before they used it

Note:
- General trend, people loved Go at the time
- And TypeScript (pretty good)
- So what is rust?

Note:
---

## General considerations

- An approachable syntax for Python Developers, unlike functional languages
- Both languages have liberal licenses, are "democratic" and have a friendly, big community
- Rust uses cargo as a package manager (> pip)
- Rust is currently hyped by a lot of people, some people think of it as a fancier go, which is wrong

# Rust:

## The Easy Parts

Note:
- let's go right into it, we will 
---

## A first example

Rust:
```rust
fn foo(a: i64, b: i64) -> i64 {
    return a + b
}
```

Python:

```python
def foo(a: int, b: int) -> int {
    return a + b
}
```

Note:
---

## Simplified

```rust
fn foo(a: i64, b: i64) -> i64 {
    a + b
}
```

Note:
---

## Adding an if

```rust
fn foo(a: i64, b: i64) -> i64 {
    if a >= 0 {
        a + b
    } else {
        # First macro, yay!
        println!("Found a negative value");
        0
    }
}
```

Note:
---

## Simple Strings

Rust:

```rust
fn foo(a: String) -> String {
    if !a.ends_with("s") {
        a += "s";
    }
    a
}
```

Python:

```python
def foo(a: str) -> str {
    if !a.endswith("s") {
        a += "s"
    }
    return a
}
```

Note:
---

## String References

```rust
fn foo(a: &str) -> &str {
    if !a.ends_with("s") {
        # Does not compile, we cannot change
        # an immutable reference.
        a += "s";
    }
    a
}
```

Use this instead:

```rust
fn foo(a: &str) -> String {
    let a = a.to_owned();
    if !a.ends_with("s") {
        a += "s";
    }
    a
}
```

### Lifetimes in Higher-Rank Trait Bounds (HRTB)

An issue I created at [rust-lang/rust#91942](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/91942)

```rust
fn funnel<'lt> (f: impl Fn(&mut State<'lt, '_>))
  -> impl Fn(&mut State<'lt, '_>)
where
    'static : 'lt, // make it turbofishable
{
    f
}

```

Note:
---

### Trait lifetime bounds are bugged

An issue I created at [rust-lang/rust#92520](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/92520)

```rust
trait Trait<'global: 'a, 'a, HackyProof = &'a &'global ()>
```

Note:
'>
---

###  Is Rust buggier than Python

- Rust has 3200 open bugs
- Python has 2800 open bugs
- Like Python, Rust feels extremely stable 
- Some of Rust's complex feature are buggy

Note:
---

# Case Studies

Note:
- Advantages of languages and architecture choices
- No, none of the case studies cover the ego-shooter
- Enterprise Software rambling
---

## Case Study #1: Jedi

- The open source alternative to PyCharm
- Plugins for all major editors
- 460m Downloads on PyPI

Note:
- Was a working prototype after 3 months
- except Exception
- CPU bound
---

## Case Study #2:
### Jedi & Mypy in Rust

Note:
---

## Jedi & Mypy in Rust

- Passing 1/5 of the Mypy test suite
- 20x faster with a debug build than Mypy
- 650x faster with a release build than Mypy
- Not finished
- Not public

Note:
Do not underestimate me, it will be finished
---

## Case Study #3: cloudscale.ch

<img src="cloudscale-servers.png" alt="cloudscale.ch Launch Server" width="600"/>

Note:
- VMs
- Like most web projects it's IO-bound, limited by the database or services
- We initially had 3 months to rewrite in Python, would choose Rust now, but might be a mistake
---

## Summary

| Rust Strengths                              | Python Strengths     |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| High performance,<br/>CPU/Memory bound problems | Data Science, AI     |
| Avoiding bugs                               | Prototypes           |
| Team of very capable devs                   | Team of average devs |
| You want one binary                         | Hackable / Debuggable |

Note:
- really good = type system experience
- Also note I like the non-enterprise context
